1.Create Graph: Construct a directed graph from the list of tickets.
2.Sort Destinations: Ensure the destinations for each city are sorted to guarantee the lexicographically smallest route in case of multiple options.
3.Initialize Route: Prepare a data structure to hold the final travel route.
4.DFS Function: Implement a DFS function to traverse the graph.
5.Backtrack Route: Append cities to the route as we backtrack in the DFS function.
6.Reverse Route: Since we backtrack, reverse the route at the end to get the correct travel order.
